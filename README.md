The repository content is designed to make participation in Learning from Big Data as easy and enjoyable for you as possible. The content of this repo is being continuously updated until the last day of classes. 

In the lectures, we will use R to illustrate implementation-related key points. The code files will be published in this repository ahead of the lecture. Please make sure that you can execute the code, and solve eventual challenges, before joining the class so you can easily follow the coding parts in the lectures.  

For the homework assignment, use the structure found in the final assignment file, available in this repo.

## Getting up to speed - Course preparation

As preparation for the course, or simply to fine-tune your R basic skills if needed, please consider studying the material covered in the beginner's section of https://www.kaggle.com/learn-guide/r.
In general, use textbooks or online resources to fill gaps in your skills whenever needed.

## Tutorials

Bob Rombach, PhD student of my research group at RSM will be holding R tutorials as follows:
* Tutorial 0: Introduction to R and R Markdown
* Tutorial 1.1: R on supervised learning examples
* Tutorial 1.2: R on unsupervised learning examples
* Tutorial 1.3: R Q&A given module report
* Tutorial 2.1: R on greedy and regret examples
* Tutorial 2.2: R on TS examples
* Tutorial 2.3: R on UCB  examples
* Tutorial 2.4: R Q&A given module report

All these tutorials are optional. Feel free to attend if you would like to get some tips, but do make sure you first try to install it on your computer before the class.  The detailed schedule of tutorials is [here](https://github.com/guiliberali/Big-Data-2025/blob/main/tutorials/Tutorial%20plan.xlsx).
